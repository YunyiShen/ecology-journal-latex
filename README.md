# LaTeX templates for ecology journals

I am quite frustrated that bunch of ecology journals do allow latex submissions but do not provide templates. So I decide to have an unofficial repo of templates for those I've submitted to. These templates are not official and often implemented using hacky ways (like hack the `\date{}` command).
